## Assessment Overview
This assessment had two tasks to complete; The first task was to load all of the data from the Hours by Task Excel file, which was comprised of multiple sheets, and combine them into one master sheet. The second task was to draw three insights from the data that could be used to improve how certain Kroger stores are operated. I was given three Excel files to use for my analysis; A Hours by Task file which showed the total hours spent over 3 months by store, by labor task, for 3 departments and 4 divisions. A Task Category Mapping, which showed the names of the labor tasks and the categories and subcategories associated with them. Finally, a Store Square Feet file, which showed each store's selling square feet. 


## Task 1: Loading the Hours by Task File into one sheet

For my analysis, I decided to combine all three data files into one master sheet. This allowed me to be able to create multiple data frames from a single data frame.

## Task 2: My 3 Insights
From my analysis, I chose three different categories and sought to show the time that each store spent on them and in which department. These categories were "Cleaning", "Stocking", and customer service. I also wanted to see if the square footage of a store was correlated to the amount of time spent on these tasks. 

### Cleaning

## Final Thoughts and Observations
Since these aren't the true hours worked, there could be several reasons that contributed to the data and analysis I did. While I believe that the square footage of a store isn't correlated to the amount of time spent on these tasks, there are certain tasks that could be improved across many different stores that could, in turn, improve sales. Cleaning, for example, could be improved across the board. Customer service was relatively high, so the focus of improvement could be shifted to another category.
